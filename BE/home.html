 <p>Agricultural productivity is
something on which economy
highly depends. If proper
care is not taken in this area
then it causes serious effects
on plants and due to which
respective product quality,
quantity or productivity is
affected. Detection of plant
disease through some automatic
technique is beneficial
as it reduces a large work of
monitoring in big farms of
crops, and at very early stage
itself it detects the symptoms
of diseases i.e. when they
appear on plant leaves.
Image segmentation, which
is an important aspect for
disease detection in plant
leaf disease, is done by using
genetic algorithm. </p>
